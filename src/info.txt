Pattern Recognition:

1. by amount of strokes
use integers
Problem: many Kanjis consist of 2 Strokes like 二 and 十
Solution: difference in direction

2. by 'type' of strokes (and their order)
2a. horizontal
2b. vertical
2c. ascend
2d. descend
use enum
Problem: Kanjis like 土 and 工 have the same order of stroke type
Solution: usage of structural features

3. by structural features
3a. intersection
3b. connection
3c. above or beneath
3d. left or right
use matrix NxN
